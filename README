This directory was created to demonstrate the use of Improved Roman Reference Pixel Correction for reference pixel correction.

This directory contains:
-3 raw frames as test images for a single detector, C1.
-A textfile listing these 3 test frames.
-A directory IRRC_calfiles containing the IRRC weights used in the correction and bad reference pixel masks for each detector, C1-4.
-A script to IRRC correct these images.

To run the script, use teh following syntax:
python example_irrc.py [text file list of frames] [detector] [directory with IRRC weights and bad reference pixel masks]

For example,
python example_irrc.py frame_list.txt C1 ./IRRC_calfiles
